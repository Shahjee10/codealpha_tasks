# 🛒 Walmart Sales Data Analysis (CodeAlpha Internship Task 1)

### 🎯 Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Data Analyst Internship at CodeAlpha**, focusing on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Walmart’s sales dataset.  
The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve business decision-making and forecasting accuracy.

---

### 📊 Objective
- Analyze Walmart’s historical sales data.
- Identify key factors influencing weekly sales.
- Explore the impact of holidays and seasonal trends.
- Provide actionable business insights through visualizations.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning  
  - `numpy` – for numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for visualization  
  - `scipy` – for statistical testing  

---

### 🧩 Dataset
The dataset contains **historical sales data from Walmart**, including:
- Store details  
- Weekly sales  
- Holiday indicators  
- Temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate

---

### 🔍 Project Workflow (Step-by-Step EDA)
#### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Loaded dataset using Pandas.
- Displayed shape, column names, and data types.
- Identified missing values and data inconsistencies.

#### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handled null values and duplicates.
- Converted `Date` column to `datetime` format.
- Created new time-based columns like `Year`, `Month`, and `Day`.

#### 3️⃣ Exploratory Analysis
- Calculated summary statistics and distributions.
- Explored relationships between weekly sales and external factors (temperature, CPI, etc.).
- Compared holiday vs. non-holiday sales trends.

#### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Visualized time-series sales patterns.
- Correlation heatmaps to detect strong relationships.
- Bar and box plots for seasonal analysis.
- Highlighted outliers and patterns across different stores.

#### 5️⃣ Hypothesis Testing
- Performed **T-test** to compare holiday vs. non-holiday average sales.
- Result: **Holiday sales were significantly higher**, confirming the seasonal revenue effect.

#### 6️⃣ Insights & Findings
- Peak sales occur during **holiday seasons**.  
- Sales tend to vary across different months and years.  
- External factors like fuel price and unemployment show minor correlations.

# 🎨 Visualization Task (CodeAlpha Internship Task 2)

### 🧾 Overview
This task focused on **transforming raw data into meaningful and interactive visualizations** using Python libraries.  
The goal was to **tell a story through visuals**, improving understanding and interpretation of data patterns.

---

### 🔍 Objective
- Convert unprocessed data into visual insights.
- Use Python visualization libraries for professional data storytelling.
- Make the notebook self-explanatory — every code block is clearly **explained and commented** like a README.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **pandas** – data preprocessing
- **matplotlib** – fundamental chart plotting
- **seaborn** – enhanced statistical visualization

---

### 📊 Workflow
1️⃣ Loaded and explored raw dataset.  
2️⃣ Cleaned missing or inconsistent values.  
3️⃣ Applied multiple types of visualizations (bar, line, histogram, box, and correlation heatmap).  
4️⃣ Explained each code section in Markdown for clarity.  
5️⃣ Highlighted key insights from the plots.  

---

### 📈 Summary
Today’s task was all about **turning raw data into visuals** that speak.  
From understanding data distributions to comparing relationships between features — each visualization helped uncover hidden patterns and trends that numbers alone can’t reveal.

---

### 🧠 Learnings
- Translating data into visuals enhances comprehension.  
- A well-labeled, explained notebook doubles as both **codebase and documentation**.  
- Each visualization tells a unique story about the dataset.
